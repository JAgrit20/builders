				<h1>Mozilla’s Fix-The-Internet Spring MVP Lab</h1>
				<p>The internet’s amazing, weird, sometimes a little icky. Let’s face it: it could use some fixing. Are you a student, coder, designer, creator who wants to help us build new services and platforms that foster collaboration during this crisis, or put privacy first, or combat filter bubbles and polarization, or AI platforms that work for the end user, the citizen? Mozilla’s Fix-The-Internet MVP Lab is an 8 week-long incubator-style program this Spring to mobilize & fund around products and technologies that enable everyone to connect and build a better society. Participants receive a $2,500 stipend to build an MVP of their product idea.</p>
				<p>Want to learn more about our Fix-The-Internet Topics?  Register to join our <a href="https://mozilla.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZ0odOCqrTkv1aW13JeCZdNdI96m2z5OgA">Live Q+A on Thursday, March 26th at 8pm ET.</a></p>
				<p><strong>Come build with us</strong>: <strong class="upper"><a href="https://mozilla2.forms.fm/fix-the-internet-spring-lab/forms/7758">Apply now</a></strong> for our Spring MVP Lab if you want to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of your idea this Spring. We are looking for products in the following areas:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="highlight"><strong>Collaboration &amp; society</strong>, particularly in view of the current global crisis: (i) Foster better collaboration online, (ii) Grassroots collaboration around issues &amp; emergencies, (iii) Local &amp; neighborhood support networks, (iv) Supporting small businesses, (v) Social money-pooling for issues, people & businesses.</li>
					<li><strong>Decentralized web:</strong> build a new, decentralized architecture for the internet from infrastructure, communications, media &amp; money using the blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies.</li>
					<li><strong>Messaging &amp; social networking:</strong> can we build a new way to communicate online that favors privacy, people, and users' interests? What needs to evolve?</li>
					<li><strong>Misinformation &amp; content:</strong> ideas for services that help us get beyond polarization, filter bubbles and fake news.</li>
					<li><strong>Surveillance capitalism:</strong> whether it’s big tech or governments, everyone’s collecting your data. How do we put the user back in control of their data?</li>
					<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> that work to benefit communities and citizens.</li>
				</ul>
