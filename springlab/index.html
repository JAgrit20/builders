				<p><i>April 16. Hey Builders... THANK YOU! In the last 4 weeks more than 1300 of you all have come together to create this community of "builders" to keep the internet awesome.  Based on all the energy in this community, we decided to offer two programs instead of one: (1) Spring Builders MVP Lab and (2) Spring Builders Open Lab (new!).</p>
					
					<p>The Spring Builders Open Lab provides a unique 8 week structure to design, build, test, pivot with a peer group of teams and even AWS/Google Cloud resources. Review the benefits of Open Lab and sign up <a href="https://forms.gle/tbkoX2Psv4Fz4DhD6">here</a>.
					</i></p>

					The internet's amazing, weird, sometimes a little icky. Let’s face it: it could use some fixing. Are you a
					student, coder, designer, creator who wants to help us build new services and platforms that foster
					collaboration during this crisis, or put privacy first, or combat filter bubbles and polarization, or AI
					platforms that work for the end user, the citizen? Mozilla’s Fix-The-Internet MVP Lab is an 8 week-long
					incubator-style program this Spring to mobilize & fund around products and technologies that enable everyone
					to connect and build a better society.</p>
				<p>Come to the <a href="https://mozilla.zoom.us/meeting/register/uJYkde-rrTIqjIhq-c8q8YtZQKQuZ1M8_A">Open Q+A for the Mozilla Fix-The-Internet MVP Lab</a> on Saturday, April 4th 3:00PM ET.</p>
				<p>Join our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/mozillabuilders/shared_invite/zt-czo6bp37-R9I5mKJVYPtCkTQFu1NLWw">Mozilla Builders Slack channel</a> and visit the <a href="https://github.com/fix-the-internet/spring-mvp-lab/issues">Fix the Internet Github Issues</a> page to discuss ideas and find teammates.</p>
				<p><strong>Come build with us</strong>: <strong class="upper"><a
							href="https://mozilla2.forms.fm/fix-the-internet-spring-lab/forms/7758">Apply now</a></strong> for our
					Spring MVP Lab if you want to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of your idea this Spring. We are looking
					for products in the following areas:</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="highlight"><strong>Collaboration &amp; Society</strong>, particularly in view of the current global
						crisis: (i) Foster better collaboration online, (ii) Grassroots collaboration around issues &amp;
						emergencies, (iii) Local &amp; neighborhood support networks, (iv) Supporting small businesses, (v) Social
						money-pooling for issues, people & businesses.</li>
					<li><strong>Decentralized Web:</strong> build a new, decentralized architecture for the internet from
						infrastructure, communications, media &amp; money using the blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies.</li>
					<li><strong>Messaging &amp; Social Networking:</strong> can we build a new way to communicate online that
						favors privacy, people, and users' interests? What needs to evolve?</li>
					<li><strong>Misinformation &amp; Content:</strong> ideas for services that help us get beyond polarization,
						filter bubbles and fake news.</li>
					<li><strong>Surveillance Capitalism:</strong> whether it’s big tech or governments, everyone’s collecting your
						data. How do we put the user back in control of their data?</li>
					<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> that work to benefit communities and citizens.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>If you’re not quite able to dive in this Spring, check back here soon for all the details for the
					<strong>Summer Incubator</strong>.
					If you’re new to Mozilla, make sure to check out <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">our

				<p>We are an equal opportunity organization and value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race,
					religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or
					disability status.</p>

				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p class="question"><strong>What is Mozilla Builders and what is the difference between the Spring Builders MVP Lab and the Open Lab?
							</strong></p>
						<div class="answer">
							<p> Mozilla Builders is a community of product-minded builders looking to create products and services that will make the world better by leveraging the connective and computing powers of the internet. Today's builders live all over the world and have been forming teams across borders to build kick ass new products.</p>

								<p>To support builders around the world, we created two programs:</p> 
								<p>(1) Spring Builders MVP Lab is an individually mentored program for 24 teams who apply and are accepted into the program. Direct mentorship, a $2,500 per participant stipend, and cash prizes are a part of this program. The goal is to work directly with promising teams with well formulated ideas ready to move quickly and build over 8 weeks. </p>
								<p>(2) Spring Builders Open Lab is a program that is open to the 500+ teams who have joined our community this Spring and applied for the Spring MVP Lab. It’s an 8 week design, build, test model for building a product quickly with the support of a peer group and a larger community of builders. The Open Lab also has weekly open office hours, guest lectures, and AWS/Google Cloud resources for committed teams. The key requirement of this program is to stay committed to the 8 week structure and to ship + test your products!
								</p>

					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="question"><strong>Why should you apply?</strong></p>
						<div class="answer">
							<p> Participation in this program will be invaluable experience in your pursuit of a career in the industry and will provide you with access to the following:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The chance to build a meaningful product from the ground up.
								</li>
								<li>
									A panel of kickass Mentors (see above) who will be able to provide personal mentorship throughout the process.
								</li>
								<li>
									A $2500 stipend for acceptance to the program and completing the MVP, and a chance at a $25,000 cash prize.
								</li>
								<li>
									The opportunity to feature your work with Mozilla MVP Lab on successful launch of your product.
								</li>
							</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="question"><strong>What, exactly, is the commitment?</strong></p>
						<div class="answer">
							<p> Expect to get out of this program whatever you put into it. The larger the time investment, the higher quality your product will be and the better chance of winning. That said, by no means are we expecting you to put a pause on school or your job to participate. We want good ideas and passionate people!</p>

					</li>

<li>
						<p class="question"><strong>What kinds of ideas are you looking for?</strong></p>
						<div class="answer">
							<p>Please review the six focus areas above. But don’t let your thinking be constrained. Imagine the internet
								as you wish it could be. Here are some interesting reads to get you thinking:</p>
							<ul>

							</ul>
							<p>If you want to start your ideation with some terrific tech building blocks, here's some technology that has the potential to break the status quo:</p>

							</ul>
							<p>We hate to give examples of types of things you might want to build, lest we limit your imagination, but since you insist, here's some. Deep breath. WebRTC video conferencing that doesn't suck (or steal your privacy), a messaging network that no government can shut down, awesome new instagram feeds from distributed storage, a Scuttlebutt-based messaging app that's resistant to abuse, social money pooling for local SMBs, YT-like video streaming site built on the dWeb, local AI clients for content personalization.</p>

						<p class="question"><strong>What, exactly, is the commitment?</strong></p>
						<div class="answer">
							<p> Check out <a href="https://medium.com/mozilla-builders/make-it-real-how-to-make-your-application-for-mozillas-mvp-lab-stronger-c7e07643467c">our blog post</a> on how to put together a strong application.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class='question'><strong>Can I apply by myself?</strong></p>
						<div class="answer">
							<ul>
								<li>In rare cases, one person can build a product all by themselves. Since you’ll be building software,
									such a person would, by definition, be a strong coder who also has strong design and product sense.</li>
								<li>In the vast majority of cases, it takes a team of 2 to 4 people to build shippable software, including
									engineering, design, and other key skills.</li>
								<li>Not all applicants to this program will be accepted. Applicants who apply with a team, or who find a
									team before we review their application, will have a better chance of being accepted into this program.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class='question'><strong>What if I want to apply but don't have a team?</strong></p>
						<div class="answer">
							<ul>
								<li>We have created a <a href="https://github.com/fix-the-internet/spring-mvp-lab/issues">GitHub
										repository and issues list</a> and a <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/mozillabuilders/shared_invite/zt-czo6bp37-R9I5mKJVYPtCkTQFu1NLWw">Slack channel</a> where you can post your project and look for teammates. You can also
									pivot or abandon your project as you connect with teammates.</li>
								<li>We do expect to accept a number of solo applicants into the program on a provisional basis. For those folks, their first
									order of business will be to build a team in the first 2 weeks of the program. This will be a requirement for full acceptance into the program.</li>
							</ul>

					</li>
					<li>
						<p class='question'><strong>What if I want to apply but don't have an idea?</strong></p>
						<div class="answer">

						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class='question'><strong>Do I need to already have start-up/product off the ground? </strong></p>
						<div class="answer">
							<p>No, not at all! In fact, we want new, original ideas that are built from scratch for the purpose of this lab. Check out our <a href="https://github.com/fix-the-internet/spring-mvp-lab/issues">GitHub
								repository and issues list</a> and <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/mozillabuilders/shared_invite/zt-czo6bp37-R9I5mKJVYPtCkTQFu1NLWw">Slack channel</a> to see what other people are talking about doing and to find potential teammates.
