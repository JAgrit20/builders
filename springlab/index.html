				<p><i>March 25, 2020. Dear friends, Covid-19 is upending all of our lives. You may not be able to engage with us today. Please join us when you’re ready… or jump in today. This program is completely online, and will not be affected by the Covid-19 crisis. All activities, incl. office hours etc, are completely online.</i></p>

					The internet's amazing, weird, sometimes a little icky. Let’s face it: it could use some fixing. Are you a
					student, coder, designer, creator who wants to help us build new services and platforms that foster
					collaboration during this crisis, or put privacy first, or combat filter bubbles and polarization, or AI
					platforms that work for the end user, the citizen? Mozilla’s Fix-The-Internet MVP Lab is an 8 week-long
					incubator-style program this Spring to mobilize & fund around products and technologies that enable everyone
					to connect and build a better society.</p>
				<p>Want to learn more about our Fix-The-Internet Topics? Register to join our <a
						href="https://mozilla.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZ0odOCqrTkv1aW13JeCZdNdI96m2z5OgA">Live Q+A on Thursday,
						March 26th at 8pm ET.</a> Also, join our <a href="https://mozillabuilders.slack.com/">Slack channel</a> to discuss ideas and find teammates.</p>
				<p><strong>Come build with us</strong>: <strong class="upper"><a
							href="https://mozilla2.forms.fm/fix-the-internet-spring-lab/forms/7758">Apply now</a></strong> for our
					Spring MVP Lab if you want to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of your idea this Spring. We are looking
					for products in the following areas:</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="highlight"><strong>Collaboration &amp; Society</strong>, particularly in view of the current global
						crisis: (i) Foster better collaboration online, (ii) Grassroots collaboration around issues &amp;
						emergencies, (iii) Local &amp; neighborhood support networks, (iv) Supporting small businesses, (v) Social
						money-pooling for issues, people & businesses.</li>
					<li><strong>Decentralized Web:</strong> build a new, decentralized architecture for the internet from
						infrastructure, communications, media &amp; money using the blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies.</li>
					<li><strong>Messaging &amp; Social Networking:</strong> can we build a new way to communicate online that
						favors privacy, people, and users' interests? What needs to evolve?</li>
					<li><strong>Misinformation &amp; Content:</strong> ideas for services that help us get beyond polarization,
						filter bubbles and fake news.</li>
					<li><strong>Surveillance Capitalism:</strong> whether it’s big tech or governments, everyone’s collecting your
						data. How do we put the user back in control of their data?</li>
					<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> that work to benefit communities and citizens.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>If you’re not quite able to dive in this Spring, check back here soon for all the details for the
					<strong>Summer Startup Studio</strong>.
					If you’re new to Mozilla, make sure to check out <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">our
						manifesto</a>.</p>
				<p>We are an equal opportunity organization and value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race,
					religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or
					disability status.</p>

			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p class="question"><strong>Why should you apply?</strong></p>
					<div class="answer">
						<p> Participation in this program will be invaluable experience in your pursuit of a career in the industry and will provide you with access to the following: 
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The chance to build a meaningful product from the ground up. 
							</li>
							<li>
								A panel of kickass coaches (see below) who will be able to provide personal mentorship throughout the process.
							</li>
							<li>
								A $2500 stipend for completing the MVP and a chance at a $25,000 cash prize. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The opportunity to feature your work with Mozilla MVP Lab on successful launch of your product. 
							</li>
						</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="question"><strong>What, exactly, is the commitment?</strong></p>
					<div class="answer">
						<p> Expect to get out of this program whatever you put into it. The larger the time investment, the higher quality your product will be and the better chance of winning. That said, by no means are we expecting you to put a pause on school or your job to participate. We want good ideas and passionate people!</p>
						
				</li>

				<li>
					<p class="question"><strong>What kinds of ideas are you looking for?</strong></p>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>Please review the six focus areas above. But don’t let your thinking be constrained. Imagine the internet
							as you wish it could be. Here are some interesting reads to get you thinking:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Mozilla&apos;s <a
									href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/04/23/its-complicated-mozillas-2019-internet-health-report/">2019
									Internet Health Report</a></li>

									href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/13/magazine/internet-china-wechat.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share">what
									might be our future</a></li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='question'><strong>Can I apply by myself?</strong></p>
					<div class="answer">
						<ul>
							<li>In rare cases, one person can build a product all by themselves. Since you’ll be building software,
								such a person would, by definition, be a strong coder who also has strong design and product sense.</li>
							<li>In the vast majority of cases, it takes a team of 2 to 4 people to build shippable software, including
								engineering, design, and other key skills.</li>
							<li>Not all applicants to this program will be accepted. Applicants who apply with a team, or who find a
								team before we review their application, will have a better chance of being accepted into this program.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='question'><strong>What if I want to apply but don't have a team?</strong></p>
					<div class="answer">
						<ul>
							<li>We have created a <a href="https://github.com/fix-the-internet/spring-mvp-lab/issues">GitHub
									repository and issues list</a> and a <a href="https://mozillabuilders.slack.com/">Slack channel</a> where you can post your project and look for teammates. You can also
								pivot or abandon your project as you connect with teammates.</li>
							<li>We do expect to accept a number of solo applicants into the program on a provisional basis. For those folks, their first
								order of business will be to build a team in the first 2 weeks of the program. This will be a requirement for full acceptance into the program.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='question'><strong>What if I want to apply but don't have an idea?</strong></p>
					<div class="answer">
						<ul>
							<li>We have created a <a href="https://github.com/fix-the-internet/spring-mvp-lab/issues">GitHub
									repository and issues list</a> and a <a href="https://mozillabuilders.slack.com/">Slack channel</a> where you can look for teammates and ideas.</li>
					
						</ul>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='question'><strong>Do I need to already have start-up/product off the ground? </strong></p>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>No, not at all! In fact, we want new, original ideas that are built from scratch for the purpose of this lab. Check out our <a href="https://github.com/fix-the-internet/spring-mvp-lab/issues">GitHub
							repository and issues list</a> and <a href="https://mozillabuilders.slack.com/">Slack channel</a> to see what other people are talking about doing and to find potential teammates.
