						<h2>The Mission.</h2>
						<p>The internet’s amazing, still weird, sometimes heading in the wrong direction. It could use some fixing. And it needs a lot of building. Let’s build a new generation of startups, products, services, and projects that deliver on the full promise of the internet:</p>
						<p>“Our mission is to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all. An Internet that truly puts people first, where individuals can shape their own experience and are empowered, safe and independent.”</p>
						<p>Read more about the kinds of ideas we are looking for.</p>
						<p>People like you built Firefox along with many of the building blocks of the modern internet (such as Javascript). People like you will write the next amazing chapter of the internet.</p>
