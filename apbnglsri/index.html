						<h2>The Mission.</h2>
						<p>Back in March, we put out our call for ideas to "fix-the-internet". 1500 of you showed up and well over a hundred projects are now underway. Now we're launching our v2: the Mozilla Builders Incubator.
						</p>
						<p>We're looking to invest in people, projects, and technologies that shape the internet and have a positive impact without having to only worry about the bottom line. Firefox, Wikipedia, Wordpress, DuckDuckGo, Kickstarter, Etsy, Node.js, Ethereum. We've done it before. We're going to build 1000 more. 
						</p>
						<p>People like you built Firefox. People like you will write the next amazing chapter of the internet.</p>
